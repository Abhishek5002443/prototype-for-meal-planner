This is a project which optimally generates a highly nutritious meal chart for a whole week that 
people can follow in order to maintain their good health. 

Current features that this project can provide are:

1. Generating highly nutritious meal-chart for whole week.
2. Providing groceries buying list that are required to follow meal-chart.
3. Meal-chart is highly optimized with budget constraint that user provides.

Client-side or user interface:

Currently a flask based light weight web application is used for protyping. 
Also a sample program file is provided that can be executed to see expected results.

As this project is in its initial stages so some features might not be available as of
now but it will be added soon as we are working actively on this project.

Suggestions and contributions are highly welcomed!!
